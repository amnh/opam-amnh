A Phylogenetic Library for OCaml
Phylocaml is a Phylogenetic Library for OCaml that allows phylogenetic inference
under a number of criterias including (likelihood, parsimony, kolmogorov
complexity), as well as a variaty of topologies (rooted binary trees,
unrooted binary trees / free trees, and rooted time-dependent binary networks).
The library is built to allow the extension of the provided methods easily,
along with exploring topologies concepts directly.

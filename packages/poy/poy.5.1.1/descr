POY is a phylogenetic analysis program


POY is a phylogenetic analysis program that supports multiple kinds of data
(e.g. morphology, nucleotides, genes and gene regions, chromosomes, whole
genomes, etc). POY is particular in that it can perform true sequence
optimization and phylogeny inference simultaneously (i.e. input sequences need
not to be prealigned). Insertions, deletions, and rearrangements, can then be
included in the overall tree score (under Maximum Parsimony), or in the model
(under Maximum Likelihood). A variety of heuristic algorithms have been
developed for this purpose and are implemented in POY.
